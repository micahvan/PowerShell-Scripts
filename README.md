# PowerShell-Scripts
A llist of PowerShell scripts I've written to help automate some common Windows tasks

Windows_Software_Inventory.ps1 - This script will retrieve all Windows Apps and Programs installed and display them as 2 CSV files, one for Apps and one for Programs. File name will include date ran.

Remove_Selected_Apps.ps1 - This script will remove listed apps from the Windows system. Can be performed machine wide or per user. Edit the script to include your list of apps to remove.
